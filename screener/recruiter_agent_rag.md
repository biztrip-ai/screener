# BizTrip Background Info

[BizTrip.ai](http://biztrip.ai/) is reimagining corporate travel through the power of artificial intelligence. We are redesigning the corporate travel experience from the ground up, and we're looking for passionate innovators who want to transform an industry ripe for disruption. Our founders have deep roots in the travel industry, plus experience at some of the best Silicon Valley companies including Stripe and Heroku. BizTrip was co-founded by [Andrew Ng](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Andrew_Ng) and is backed by his [AI Fund](https://aifund.ai/).

BizTrip was founded by Tom Romary, who build another startup Yapta, 15 years ago, that tried to build the “personal assistant for travel”. But that company never completed the mission, and now with AI tech that true vision can be realized.

Corporate travel is back. In 2025 total travel spend will exceed pre-COVID levels, reaching $1.65T worldwide, expected to rise to $2T by 2028\. And yet from a technical standpoint, corporate travel is stuck in the past. The market is dominated by legacy tech at every layer, from the EDIFACT systems run by the GDS players, even to the “modern” online booking tools and expense management tools offered by Concur and Serko.  Lack of innovation means that Travel Management Companies (“TMCs” like AMEX and BCD Travel) provide high-touch, concierge travel services for high fees to the corporate market.

The heads of corporate travel programs understand this problem. They experience high TMC fees and increased leakage of travel bookings away from their managed programs onto personal travel sites. This leakage reduces their ability to negotiate rates, control costs, and manage travel risks to their employees.

The BizTrip.ai platform will offer an intelligent, AI-powered travel management experience to the corporate traveler. This modern experience will reduce booking leakage and also reduce human agent costs. Travel managers will improve adherence to corporate policy, helping them to control and reduce overall travel costs. 

The platform will be licensed directly to enterprise corporate clients. BizTrip will offer the leading AI layer to enhance the experience and reduce the cost of corporate travel. An ML based optimization engine will align traveler preferences with program rules and price prediction to ensure travelers exploit negotiated content rates and lowest possible fares. The platform will sell to corporate travel heads on the basis of cost reduction, improved predictability, and risk reduction, while offering their travelers  an experience comparable or better than personal travel sites. 

Beyond corporates, TMCs who recognize their need to evolve and reduce their dependence on live agents are already lining up to white-label the BizTrip AI agent.  

BizTrip is founded by Tom Romary, a 30yr veteran of the travel industry, Founder/CEO of Yapta (acquired by Coupa), prior SVP at Deem, VP at Lending Club, and VP Marketing at Alaska Airlines. Tom created the first airfare *re-shopping* system at Yapta which became an industry standard. Tom is joined by Scott Persinger, founder at Cloudconnect (acquired by Salesforce), founder of supercog.ai \- an AI agent platform company \- prior SVP at Tatari, and Head of APMs at Stripe. Mike Daly, EVP of Sales at Serko, board member at the Global Business Travel Alliance, will join soon as CRO. 

A large TAM of $24B for BizTrip is based on the significant savings delivered to corporations by saving time, reducing “high touch” fees from TMCs (and replacing agents), and delivering consistent price monitoring/re-shopping, all of which is estimated to be 8% of the corporations’  total travel spend.  BizTrip retains 15% of that delivered savings as revenue.  

The company is in active sales discussions with leading enterprises including Moderna, Genentech, and Salesforce, plus TMCs World Travel and Cain Travel. Initial customer trials will start in summer 2025\.
